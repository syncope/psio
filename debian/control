Description: wrapper library for unified read access to most common x-ray data formats
 A simple wrapper library that allows unified read access
 to most common data formats inuse at x-ray synchrotron facilities.
 In it's most simple form it yields an iterator to the
 data numpy array(s) for the given files. This interface is very
 similar to reading of standard files in Python.
 For container data (e.g. hdf5) random access ("indexing") is possible.
 Supported file formats derive from the incorporated libraries:
   - hdf5: h5py
   - .edf, .cbf, .tiff, ... 
   -- all supported formats by fabio (by J.Kieffer, ESRF)
 Inclusion of fio files and plain numpy array files is in progress
