Welcome to PSIO's documentation!
================================

This is the documentation for the Photon Science Input Output package -- PSIO.
The package provides a unified access to different input formats.
Internally it uses existing libraries, namely h5py and fabio (by J.Kieffer, ESRF).

It provides an interface similar to standard files in Python.
In addition random access ("indexing") is possible, where applicable.
